# Password-Generator

The Password Generator is a simple Python program that allows users to create strong, random passwords based on a specified number of characters, digits, and symbols. Users can input the total password length and define how many letters, numbers, and special characters they want in the password.

The program then generates a secure password by randomly selecting characters from each category, ensuring a balanced and unpredictable mix. It is useful for creating strong passwords that enhance security and protect sensitive accounts from unauthorized access. The program utilizes Python's random library to ensure randomness in password generation.
